Here you find examples of use of YACSGEN for every type of component.

In order to build and test the examples, you have to:
- change the SALOME installation directory in exec.sh (SALOME_DIR)
- run "build.sh"

Every example contains a "build.sh" script which shows you how to build and
test it. In the main directory, it builds and tests all the examples.
